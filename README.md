# ATM-Machine

When running this code, you will be prompted to enter an account number. 
If this number is invalid, it will keep on asking you to put another one until you enter a valid one.

Once the ATM has your account name, you will be prompted to enter your password.
If the given password is incorrect, it will keep on asking you to put another one until you enter the correct password.

After finishing the login stage, you will be shown 4 options (Check Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, and exit)
If an invalid option is picked, it will keep on asking for another one until a valid one is picked.

NOTE: This code contains 3 accounts. You will find the account number, password, and balance in the constructor when the objects account1, account2, and account3 are created and initialized.
